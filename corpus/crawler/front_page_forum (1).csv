  Hey people of COMP9444! I've noticed that neural networks has a lot of theory but also that it can be challenging to fully understand how it works to apply it to actual code since there aren't many practical video tutorials with examples of building and training your own neural network. I've done a few other online courses on neural networks and would like to share the knowledge I gained from those.
 
 
  So I'm starting a youtube channel with practical neural network coding examples to bridge that gap. My first video is on
  
   DIY linear regression using a neural network
  
  in numpy. I know that tensorflow seems a little daunting to get used to so my next video will be on getting started with tensorflow.
 
 
  I hope this helps you with getting a more detailed understanding of neural networks.
  

 
 
  Happy machine learning!"
