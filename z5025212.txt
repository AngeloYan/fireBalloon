Week 1 20/02/19
Group formed. Spent the lab time setting up Github group and Trello. Decided to do project 1 because it was more clearly defined. Specifically, chose to do a course support system which includes course admin and course content.

Week 2 25/02/19
Had group meeting. Discussed available tools and technologies to be used in the project. Lots of uncertainty because the lecturer hasn't given us access to UNSW's Academic Information Management System. We do not know if we can use it as a database or if we need to scrape data from it and create our own database.

Will be creating web app using Flask for the server and simple HTML, CSS and JS for client. This is because we are not experienced with web frameworks but we are experienced with python.

Discussed what to include in the proposal and divided work. Wrote up basic outline for epic user stories. I will be working on fleshing out epic user stories and writing user stories.
